# Cpp_API_demo    
Wrote the following code to learn and demonstrate my knowledge of Go. Prior to working on this project, I had no experience with the language
in practice. In this repo, I have a go file that creates a fibonacci sequence, and a C++ file that does the same function as a comparison, see
seeing that Go was created to correct some criticisms aimed at other langauges like C++. The last file is a Go program that builds a RESTful API for demonstation purposes. The API is quite simple compared to ones that may see active deployment, but it does contain some useful implmentations such as error handling.
